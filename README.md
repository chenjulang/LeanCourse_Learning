# Bonn Lean Course WiSe 23/24

## In this repository

You will find the Lean files in the `LeanCourse` directory:
* The `Lectures` folder contains all lectures
* The `Assignments` folder contains the assignments that you have to hand in via eCampus
* The `MIL` folder contains the exercises from the book Mathematics in Lean (so that you don't have to separately clone the `mathematics_in_lean` repository). You can find the textbook online here:
[Mathematics in Lean](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/)
(or as a
[pdf document](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathematics_in_lean/mathematics_in_lean.pdf)).

## Installation

You can either install it on a university computer or on your own laptop.

* To install it on your own laptop, follow these [instructions](https://leanprover-community.github.io/get_started.html). Then follow the steps under `Get the course repository`.

* To install Lean on a university computer, make sure to use the `fmath` local user, and ask the teacher for the password. Then run `install_lean` in a terminal and follow the steps under `Get the course repository`.

### Get the course repository

Note: To get this repository, you will need to download Lean's mathematical library, which takes about 5 GB of storage space.

* Open a terminal (I recommend `git bash` on Windows, which was installed as part of git in the first step).

* Use `cd` to navigate to a directory where you would like to create the `LeanCourse23` folder.

* Run `git clone https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse23.git`.

* Run `cd LeanCourse23`

* Run `lake exe cache get!`
  * On Windows, if you get an error that starts with `curl: (35) schannel: next InitializeSecurityContext failed` it is probably your antivirus program that doesn't like that we're downloading many files. The easiest solution is to temporarily disable your antivirus program.

* Launch VS Code, either through your application menu or by typing
  `code .` (note the dot!). (MacOS users need to take a one-off
  [extra step](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/setup/mac#_launching-from-the-command-line)
   to be able to launch VS Code from the command line.)

* If you launched VS Code from a menu, on the main screen, or in the File menu,
  click "Open folder" (just "Open" on a Mac), and choose the folder
  `LeanCourse23` (*not* one of its subfolders).

* Test that everything is working by opening `LeanCourse/Test.lean`.
  It is normal if it takes 10-40 seconds for Lean to start up.

* More files will be added to this repository during the tutorial. The first exercises are in `LeanCourse/MIL/C02_Basics/S01_Calculating.lean`.

### Get new exercises

If you have already followed the steps above, and want to get the latest exercises, open a terminal in your local copy of this repository (e.g. `cd LeanCourse23`) and then run `git pull`. This gives you the new exercises.

**Update Nov 7**: I updated the version of mathlib used in this project. This time, after running `git pull` do the following:
* Close VSCode (if you have it open)
* In your terminal, in the `LeanCourse23` folder, run `lake exe cache get!` (or `~/.elan/bin/lake exe cache get!` if `lake` cannot be found).
* Wait until the command finishes with downloading and decompressing. If you get an error, run it again.
* Now you can reopen VSCode and Lean should work again.

## Temporary ways to use Lean

You can temporarily use Codespaces or Gitpod if you have trouble installing Lean locally.

### Using Codespaces

You can temporarily play with Lean using Github codespaces. This requires a Github account, and you can only use it for a limited amount of time each month. If you are signed in to Github, click here:

<a href='https://codespaces.new/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse23' target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><img src='https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg' alt='Open in GitHub Codespaces' style='max-width: 100%;'></a>

* Make sure the Machine type is `4-core`, and then press `Create codespace`
* After 1-2 minutes you see a VSCode window in your browser. However, it is still busily downloading mathlib in the background, so give it another few minutes (5 to be safe) and then open a `.lean` file to start.

### Using Gitpod

Gitpod is an alternative to codespaces that is slightly inconvenient, since it requires you to verify your phone number.

Click this button to get started:

[![Open in Gitpod](https://gitpod.io/button/open-in-gitpod.svg)](https://gitpod.io/#https://github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse23)

This creates a virtual machine in the cloud,
and installs Lean and Mathlib.
It then presents you with a VS Code window, running in a virtual
copy of the repository.
You can update the repository by opening a terminal in the browser
and typing `git pull` followed by `lake exe cache get!` as above.

Gitpod gives you 50 free hours every month.
When you are done working, choose `Stop workspace` from the menu on the left.
The workspace should also stop automatically
30 minutes after the last interaction or 3 minutes after closing the tab.

To restart a previous workspace, go to [https://gitpod.io/workspaces/](https://gitpod.io/workspaces/).
