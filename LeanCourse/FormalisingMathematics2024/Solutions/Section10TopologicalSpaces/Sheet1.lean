# Topological Spaces in Lean

For any `X : Type`, the type `TopologicalSpace X` is the type of topologies on `X`.
`TopologicalSpace` is a structure; its four fields are one data field `IsOpen : Set X → Prop` (the
predicate on subsets of `X` saying whether or not they're open) and then three proof fields
(`isOpen_univ` saying the whole space is open, `isOpen_inter` saying the intersection of two
opens is open, and `isOpen_sUnion` saying an arbitrary union of opens is open).

Here is a simple example: let's make the discrete topology on a type.

open TopologicalSpace

variable (X : Type)

set_option linter.unusedVariables false -- please stop moaning about unused variables

example : TopologicalSpace X where
  IsOpen (s : Set X) := True -- "Is `s` open? Yes, always"
  isOpen_univ := by
    -- is the whole space open? The goal is `True`
    triv
  isOpen_inter := by
    -- let s and t be two sets
    intros s t
    -- assume they're open
    intros hs ht
    -- Is their intersection open?
    -- By definition, this means "can you prove `True`"?
    triv
  isOpen_sUnion := by
    -- say F is a family of sets
    intro F
    -- say they're all open
    intro hF
    -- Is their union open?
    triv

A much more fiddly challenge is to formalise the indiscrete topology. You will be constantly
splitting into cases in this proof.

example : TopologicalSpace X where
  IsOpen (s : Set X) := s = ∅ ∨ s = Set.univ -- empty set or whole thing
  isOpen_univ := by

    rfl
  isOpen_inter := by

  isOpen_sUnion := by
    intro F hF
    by_cases h : Set.univ ∈ F
    · right
      aesop
    · left
      have foo : ∀ s ∈ F, s = ∅ := by -- key intermediate step
        by_contra h2
        simp at h2 -- *
        rcases h2 with ⟨s, hs1, hs2⟩
        specialize hF s hs1
        aesop
      exact Set.sUnion_eq_empty.mpr foo -- found with `exact?`

-- `isOpen_empty` is the theorem that in a topological space, the empty set is open.
-- Can you prove it yourself? Hint: arbitrary unions are open

example (X : Type) [TopologicalSpace X] : IsOpen (∅ : Set X) := by
  convert isOpen_sUnion (s := ∅) ?_ <;> simp

-- The reals are a topological space. Let's check Lean knows this already
#synth TopologicalSpace ℝ
#check TopologicalSpace ℝ



-- Let's make it from first principles.

def Real.IsOpen (s : Set ℝ) : Prop :=
  -- every element of `s` has a neighbourhood (x - δ, x + δ) such that all y in this
  -- neighbourhood are in `s`
  ∀ x ∈ s, ∃ δ > 0, ∀ y : ℝ, x - δ < y ∧ y < x + δ → y ∈ s

-- Now let's prove the axioms
lemma Real.isOpen_univ : Real.IsOpen (Set.univ : Set ℝ) := by
  intro x hx
  use 37
  apply And.intro
  · norm_num
  · intros a1 h1
    simp only [Set.mem_univ]

-- will AI be able to write these proofs one day? The proof feels kind of natural
-- and obvious but I still had to write a lot of it manually
lemma Real.isOpen_inter (s t : Set ℝ) (hs : IsOpen s) (ht : IsOpen t) : IsOpen (s ∩ t) := by
  intro x hx
  obtain ⟨δs, δspos, hs⟩ := hs x (by aesop)
  obtain ⟨δt, δtpos, ht⟩ := ht x (by aesop)
  use min δs δt
  -- use min δs δt ,by positivity -- method1
  constructor -- method2
  · positivity
  rintro y ⟨h1, h2⟩
  constructor
  · apply hs
    have foo : min δs δt ≤ δs := min_le_left δs δt
    constructor <;> linarith
  · apply ht
    have foo : min δs δt ≤ δt := min_le_right δs δt
    constructor <;> linarith

lemma Real.isOpen_sUnion (F : Set (Set ℝ)) (hF : ∀ s ∈ F, IsOpen s) : IsOpen (⋃₀ F) := by
  intro x hx
  simp_rw [Set.mem_sUnion] at hx ⊢
  rcases hx with ⟨t, htF, hxt⟩
  obtain ⟨δ, hδpos, h⟩ := hF t htF x hxt
  use δ, hδpos
  peel h with h1 y hyt
  use t, htF

-- now we put everything together using the notation for making a structure
example : TopologicalSpace ℝ where
  IsOpen := Real.IsOpen
  isOpen_univ := Real.isOpen_univ
  isOpen_inter := Real.isOpen_inter
  isOpen_sUnion := Real.isOpen_sUnion

-- The "philosophy" of Lean is that one shouldn't ask what "the actual definition"
-- of a concept is, but one should just be aware of the theorem which says that
-- the definition is what you think it is. For example
