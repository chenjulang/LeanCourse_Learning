/- Let `a≤b` and `c≤d` be reals. Let φ : [a,b] → [c,d] and ψ : [c,d] → [a,b]
  be inverse bijections, and assume φ is smooth and φ' is nonvanishing
  on [a,b]. Then ψ is smooth and ψ' is nonvanishing on [c,d],
  and ψ'(y)*φ'(ψ(y))=1.

Heather Macbeth: @Kevin Buzzard This is a toy case of the inverse function theorem,
but you might need to glue together several related results. Some starting points:
docs#ContDiffAt.to_localInverse, docs#HasStrictFDerivAt.localInverse_unique

Heather Macbeth: If you want to construct the inverse, and you want to avoid invoking
the inverse function theorem on Banach spaces, you can also route through order theory
for a purely one-dimensional construction. Look at the construction of docs#Real.arctan
for a model; it uses docs#StrictMonoOn.orderIso
