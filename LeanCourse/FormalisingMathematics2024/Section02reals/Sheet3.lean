# Limits of sequences in Lean

We give the standard `ε`, `N` definition of the limit of a sequence
and prove some theorems about them.

## `fun` notation for functions

Here's how we define the functions from the naturals to the naturals
sending n to n^2 + 3:

-/

def f : ℕ → ℝ := fun n ↦ n ^ 2 + 3

/-

Mathematicians might write `n ↦ n^2+3` for this function. You can
read more about function types in the "three kinds of types" section
of Part B of the course book.

Sometimes you might find yourself with a lambda-defined function
evaluated at a number. For example, you might see something like
`(fun n => n^2 + 3) 37`, which means "take the function sending
`n` to `n^2+3` and then evaluate it at 37". You can use the `dsimp`
(or `dsimp only`) tactic to simplify this to `37^2+3`.

The reason we need to know about function notation for this sheet
is that a sequence `x₀, x₁, x₂, …` of reals on this sheet will
be encoded as a function from `ℕ` to `ℝ` sending `0` to `x₀`, `1` to `x₁`
and so on.

## Limit of a sequence.

Here's the definition of the limit of a sequence.
-/
/-- If `a(n)` is a sequence of reals and `t` is a real, `TendsTo a t`
is the assertion that the limit of `a(n)` as `n → ∞` is `t`. -/
def TendsTo (a : ℕ → ℝ) (t : ℝ) : Prop :=
  ∀ ε > 0, ∃ B : ℕ, ∀ n, B ≤ n → |a n - t| < ε

/-

We've made a definition, so it's our job to now make the API
for the definition, i.e. prove some basic theorems about it.

-/
-- If your goal is `TendsTo a t` and you want to replace it with
-- `∀ ε > 0, ∃ B, …` then you can do this with `rw tendsTo_def`.
theorem tendsTo_def {a : ℕ → ℝ} {t : ℝ} :
    TendsTo a t ↔ ∀ ε, 0 < ε → ∃ B : ℕ, ∀ n, B ≤ n → |a n - t| < ε := by
  rfl  -- true by definition

-- the eagle-eyed viewers amongst you might have spotted
-- that `∀ ε > 0, ...` and `∀ ε, ε > 0 → ...` and `∀ ε, 0 < ε → ...`
-- are all definitionally equal, so `rfl` sees through them.

## The questions

Here are some basic results about limits of sequences.
See if you can fill in the `sorry`s with Lean proofs.
Note that `norm_num` can work with `|x|` if `x` is a numeral like 37,
but it can't do anything with it if it's a variable.
-/
/-- The limit of the constant sequence with value 37 is 37. -/
theorem tendsTo_thirtyseven : TendsTo (fun n ↦ 37) 37 :=
  by
  rw [tendsTo_def]
  intro ε hε
  use 100
  intro n hn
  norm_num
  exact hε

/-- The limit of the constant sequence with value `c` is `c`. -/
theorem tendsTo_const (c : ℝ) : TendsTo (fun n ↦ c) c :=
  by
  intro ε hε
  dsimp only
  use 37
  intro n hn
  ring_nf
  norm_num
  exact hε

/-- If `a(n)` tends to `t` then `a(n) + c` tends to `t + c` -/
theorem tendsTo_add_const {a : ℕ → ℝ} {t : ℝ} (c : ℝ) (h : TendsTo a t) :
    TendsTo (fun n => a n + c) (t + c) :=
  by
  -- hints: make sure you know the maths proof!
  -- use `cases` to deconstruct an `exists`
  -- hypothesis, and `specialize` to specialize
  -- a `forall` hypothesis to specific values.
  -- Look up the explanations of these tactics in Part C
  -- of the course notes.  rw [tendsTo_def] at h ⊢
  sorry

-- you're not quite ready for this one yet though.
/-- If `a(n)` tends to `t` then `-a(n)` tends to `-t`.  -/
example {a : ℕ → ℝ} {t : ℝ} (ha : TendsTo a t) : TendsTo (fun n => -a n) (-t) := by
  sorry
-- Try this one. You don't know enough material to do it yet!
-- Where do you get stuck? The problem is that I didn't teach you
-- any "API" for (a.k.a. theorems about) the absolute value function |.|.
-- We need to figure out how to prove |(-x)| = |x|,
-- or |a - b| = |b - a| or something like that.
-- Leave this for now and try sheet 4, where you'll learn how to discover these things.
-- We'll come back to this example on sheet 5.
