# Factorization of ideals into primes

The correct generality to set up a theory of factorization of nonzero ideals into prime
ideals is to assume that the ground ring is a Dedekind domain.

There's an entire directory of files `RingTheory.DedekindDomain` containing
results about Dedekind domains. There are still a few "TODO"s though; for
example `RingTheory.DedekindDomain.Dvr` contains a definition which is
known to be equivalent to Dedekind domain, but this is not yet proved in mathlib.

## Nonzero prime ideals of a Dedekind domain.

Here's the definition of `IsDedekindDomain.HeightOneSpectrum`:

```lean
structure height_one_spectrum where
  asIdeal : Ideal R
  isPrime : asIdeal.IsPrime
  ne_bot : asIdeal ‚â† ‚ä•
```

It's the nonzero prime ideals of `R`. Because Dedekind domains are either fields or
1-dimensional, `HeightOneSpectrum R` is either empty (if `R` is a field) or
the set of maximal ideals of `R`.

A key result is that in any Dedekind domain, any nonzero ideal is contained
in only finitely many maximal ideals.

example {I : Ideal R} (hI : I ‚â† 0) : {v : HeightOneSpectrum R | v.asIdeal ‚à£ I}.Finite :=
  Ideal.finite_factors hI

-- Hence it makes sense to take a product over these factors.
-- The theorem `ideal.finprod_height_one_spectrum_factorization`
-- says that every nonzero ideal factors into primes.
