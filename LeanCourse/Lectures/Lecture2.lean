/- You type code on the left-hand side of the screen,
  and Lean automatically compiles the file and
  shows output in the *Lean Infoview* on the right.

  If you ever close the Infoview, you can press
  `ctrl+shift+enter` (or `cmd+shift+enter` on a Mac)
  to reopen it -/

/- Every expression in Lean has a type,
  and when applying a function to an argument,
  the argument must lie in the domain of the function.  -/

/- To prove a statement, you use *tactics* to construct a proof of that statement. -/

/- # Rewriting

`rw` (short for "rewrite") is a tactic that changes a part of a goal to something equal to it.
-/

#check (mul_assoc : ∀ a b c : ℝ, a * b * c = a * (b * c))
#check (mul_comm : ∀ a b : ℝ, a * b = b * a)

example (a b c : ℝ) : a * b * c = b * (a * c) := by {
  rw [mul_comm a, mul_assoc]

  }

In the following lemma the commutator of two elements of a group is defined as
`⁅g, h⁆ = g * h * g⁻¹ * h⁻¹`
-/

variable {G : Type*} [Group G]
variable (g h : G)

#check commutatorElement_def g h
#check mul_inv_rev g h
#check inv_inv g

lemma inverse_of_a_commutator : ⁅g, h⁆⁻¹ = ⁅h, g⁆ := by {
  rw [commutatorElement_def, commutatorElement_def]
  have h1 := mul_inv_rev (g * h * g⁻¹) h⁻¹
  rw [h1]
  rw [mul_inv_rev]

/-
Variants of `rw`:
* `rw [lemma1, lemma2, ...]` is short for multiple rewrites in a row
* `rw [← my_lemma]` to rewrite `my_lemma` from right to left
* `rw [my_lemma] at h` to rewrite using `my_lemma` at `h`.
You have to know what lemma you need to rewrite with.

/- A ring is a collection of objects `R` with operations `+`, `*`,
constants `0` and `1` and negation `-` satisfying the following axioms. -/

/- Let us use `calc` to prove the following from the axioms of rings. -/

example {a b c : R} (h : a + b = a + c) : b = c := by
   calc b
      = 0 + b := by rw [zero_add]
    _ = (-a + a) + b := by rw [add_left_neg]
    _ = -a + (a + b) := by rw [add_assoc]

    _ = (-a + a) + c := by rw [add_assoc]
    _ = 0 + c := by rw [add_left_neg]
    _ = c := by rw [zero_add]

/- `ring` is a tactic that automatically proves equalities in commutative rings.
`linarith` helps you to prove linear (in)equalities. -/

example (a b : ℝ) : (a + b) ^ 2 = a ^ 2 + 2 * a * b + b ^ 2 := by ring


example (a b c d : ℝ) (h1 : c = d * a + b) (h2 : b = a * d) : c = 2 * a * d := by {
  rw [h1, h2]
  ring

}

lemma hhh1 (a b c : ℝ) (h1 : 2 * a ≤ 3 * b) (h2 : 1 ≤ a) (h3 : c = 2) :
    c + a ≤ 5 * b := by linarith

#print hhh1




/-
**Forwards Reasoning** is reasoning forwards from the hypotheses that other facts must hold.
`intro` is used to introduce assumptions.
We can do this with the `have` tactic.
-/

example (p q r : Prop) (h1 : p → q) (h2 : q → r) : p → r := by {
  intro h3
  have h4 : q := h1 h3
  have h5 : r := h2 h4
  exact h5

}

/-
**Backwards reasoning** is where we chain implications backwards, deducing
what we want to prove from a combination of other statements (potentially even stronger ones).
We do this with the `apply` tactic.
-/

example (p q r : Prop) (h1 : p → q) (h2 : q → r) : p → r := by {
  intro h3
  apply h2
  apply h1
  assumption

}
variable (f g : ℝ → ℝ)
#check (Continuous.add : Continuous f → Continuous g → Continuous (f + g))
example : Continuous (fun x ↦ 2 + x * Real.sin x) := by {
  apply Continuous.add
  · apply continuous_const
  · apply Continuous.mul
    · exact continuous_id
    · exact continuous_sin

}




/-
# Difference between `rw` and `apply`
- `rw` can be used to rewrite a subexpression (almost) anywhere in the goal,
  `apply` has to match the outermost thing you are trying to prove.
- *generally* you use `rw` with an equality, and `apply` with implications and "for all" statements.
-/




/- In the following lemma, notice that `a`, `b`, `c`
  are inside curly braces `{...}`.
  This means that these arguments are *implicit*:
  they don't have to be stated, but will be figured out by Lean automatically. -/

lemma my_lemma {a b c : ℝ} (h : a + b = a + c) : b = c :=
    add_left_cancel h

example {b c : ℝ} (h : 2 + b = 2 + c) : b = c := by
  exact my_lemma h
