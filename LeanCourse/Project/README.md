## Your own project

During the second half of the course you will work on a project in any area of mathematics of your choice. You can put your project files in this folder.

Since a project likely consists of more than 1 file, it will be useful to publish this as a repository on Github.


## Formalization Tips

Here are some tips for your project.

### Read relevant mathlib files

* Look for related work in the mathlib documentation pages: https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/.
  For some results, the source code will be easier to read.
* Step through some of the proofs in Lean.
  You can open the file locally by going to e.g.
  `LeanCourse23/lake-packages/mathlib/Mathlib/Algebra/Group/Basic.lean`
  (note that the `lake-packages` folder is hidden in VSCode by default).

### Searching

During class I already discussed searching using the name (using autocomplete or the mathlib docs), or the statement (using `apply?` or `rw?`). Additional options:

* Search Mathlib using natural language: https://www.moogle.ai/
* Search Mathlib using precise syntax: https://loogle.lean-lang.org/
* Searching on Github directly: https://github.com/leanprover-community/mathlib4
  - This can be useful when searching for a mathematical theorems using its name,
    since the mathlib docs search doesn't search through the documentation of a definition or theorem (only its name).

### Asking for help

* If you have trouble with anything, make sure to ask me for help during class or office hours.
* If you are stuck on something, try replacing it by `sorry` and move on to the next part until you can ask about it.

* You are allowed to ask any AI for help. I do not necessarily recommend using them,
  often their suggestions are not very helpful.
  * ChatGPT knows some Lean, but it bad at proofs and often suggests outdated Lean 3 syntax
  * Github copilot is occasionally useful

### Writing definitions

It is useful to find a definition that already exists in mathlib and is similar to what you want.
Then you can mimic the structure of that definition.
This can also be useful in deciding whether to use `def`, `structure` or `class`.

## Presentations

During January, you should give a presentation on your project during class.
The presentation should take 20-25 minutes, plus 5 minutes for questions.

During your presentation, you can discuss the following (but you don't have to treat every point)
* Explain the mathematical content of your formalization
* Show some of the formalized work (for example if you have found interesting way to state a definition, or the statement of the theorem you proved).
* What went easily when formalizing? What was hard? Were any tools or tactics particularly useful, or did you miss a specific tactic?
* You do not have to finish your project before your presentation, so you can talk about the ongoing work.

Projects are due February 9. On November 28 I will schedule the presentations.

## Git Terminology

* `git` is a version control system. It will store changes you made, and will allow you to revert to previous versions of your files.
* All versions of your files are stored in the `git history`.
* A `commit` is a snapshot of the repository. You have to manually make a commit, and can only refer to the state of the repository at each commit.
* Before you commit you can `stage` the files that you want to include in your next commit.
* You have to `push` commits that you make locally on your computer to save them remotely (on `github.com`).
* You can `pull` to download remote commits and get them locally (added by someone else, or added by you on another computer).
* `fetch` is similar to `pull`, but it only downloads the new changes to your git history, but doesn't actually incorporate the changes
* VSCode uses the word `sync` to mean `pull` + `push`.
* A `fork` is your own remote copy of the repository on `github.com` (something like `github.com/<YourUsername>/LeanCourse23`). You cannot write to the main repository (`github.com/fpvandoorn/LeanCourse23`)
* If two people both make independent commits to a repository, you can `merge` the commits to create a new commit that has both changes.
* If both commits make a change to the same (or adjacent) lines of a file, then you will get a `merge conflict` which means you have to decide how to merge these two changes.
  - *If you get a merge conflict*: this means that you modified a file that I also modified. `git` should tell you which file(s) have a conflict. The easiest way to solve this is to duplicate (copy/paste) the file(s) with a merge conflict (to have a version with your local changes), and then in the VSCode Source Control tab right-click the file(s) and press `Discard changes`.

## Git Instructions

We will be using git via the interface on VSCode. You can also do it from the command line.

### Getting started

* Create an account on `github.com`
* On the command line, run the following two commands, with your name and email substituted in:
```
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "youremail@yourdomain.com"
```
* In VSCode, open this file and add your name and your Uni-ID at the top.
* Save all your open files
* Click on the `Source Control` button (left bar, likely the third button from the top).
* Write a small commit message (what you write is not important, but it should not be empty). Press `Commit`.
* Press `Yes` (or `Always`) on the prompt `There are no staged changes to commit. Would you like to stage all changes and commit them directly?`. This will also commit your changes to all other files, which is fine.
* Press `Sync changes`
* Press `OK` (or `OK, don't show again`) when prompted `This action will pull and push commits from and to "origin/master"`
* In the new window, press `Sign in with browser`
* if needed, sign in to Github
* Press `Authorize git-ecosystem`
* You get the message that you don't have permission to push. Press `Create Fork`.
* You should now see your changes at `github.com/<YourUsername>/LeanCourse23`.

### Pushing Later Commits

Pushing another commit after the first one is easy:

* Save all your open files
* Write a small commit message and press `Commit`.
* Press `Sync changes`

### Pulling commits

After you create your fork I believe that VSCode will not `sync` or `pull` new changes correctly by itself anymore.

To get new changes, do the following:
* Press the three dots icon at the top-right of the `source control` panel `... > Pull / Push > Fetch From All Remotes`
* Then do `... > Branch > Merge branch > upstream/master`
* (optionally) press `sync changes`.

Note: After you have created a fork, `git pull` will likely not work anymore from the command line. You can still pull changes from the command line using `git pull upstream master`.


### Command-line

If you would like to use Git from your command-line instead, you can use the commands `git pull`, `git add`, `git commit -am "commit message"`, `git push`, `git status`, `git log`, among others. Google for information how to exactly use these commands.

## Formalization Topics

You can choose a topic in any area of mathematics.

A good topic should be
* not yet in mathlib (although it's also fine to give a different proof of something already in mathlib);
* not too hard (don't overestimate how much you can do in your project);
* not require too many prerequisites that are not yet part of mathlib.

On the mathlib website there are some useful pages:
* [topics in mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib-overview.html)
* [undergraduate topics in mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad.html)
* [undergraduate topics not yet in mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/undergrad_todo.html
)
* [the full contents of mathlib](https://leanprover-community.github.io/mathlib4_docs/) (use the search in the top right)


Some suggested topics:

<!-- Do not edit the lines below to avoid merge conflicts, since I will add more suggested topics. -->

* In **algebraic topology** define CW-complexes and cellular (co)homology.
  Prove some abstract properties of CW-complexes, or compute the cellular (co)homology of some concrete CW-complexes (e.g. spheres).

* [taken] In **algebraic topology** prove the adjunction between suspensions and loop spaces.

* [taken] In **analysis**: the Fourier transform and convolution have been defined in mathlib. Show that the Fourier transform of a convolution is the product of Fourier transforms.

* In **complex analysis** define the winding number of a closed curve. You can either use topological path lifting, or its analytic definition (Cauchy's integral formula exists in mathlib).

* In **complex analysis** define the Laurent series and show that it converges on an annulus.

* [taken] In **differential geometry** define a Riemannian metric and define basic notions of Riemannian geometry.

* In **differential geometry** define smooth `n`-forms and de Rham cohomology.

* [taken] In **Galois theory** define constructible numbers in ℂ and prove that they form the smallest subfield of ℂ closed under square roots. If time permits, prove some famous impossibility results (trisection of an angle / doubling of a cube). Example reference: [David Cox, Galois Theory, Ch 10.1].

* [taken] In **game theory**, define games, pure and mixed strategies, and Nash equilibria. Assuming Brouwer's fixed point theorem, prove that there always exists a Nash equilibrium of mixed strategies. (Brouwer's fixed point theorem is [proven in Lean](https://github.com/Shamrock-Frost/BrouwerFixedPoint/blob/master/src/brouwer_fixed_point.lean#L274), though not yet incorporated in mathlib.)

* In **general topology** define some spaces that are typically used for counterexamples, such as the Hawaiian earring, the long line, wild knots or the horned sphere.

* [taken] In **group theory**, classify all groups of order 8, or if you want a challenge, of order 16.

* In **hyperbolic geometry** define the Poincaré model of hyperbolic geometry - either the disc model or the half-plane model (or another model altogether), and show that is satisfies most of Euclid's axioms for geometry, but that the parallel postulate fails.

* In **model theory**: complete types of a language are defined in mathlib. Prove for a countable theory that if there are uncountably many types with `n` free variables, then there are continuum many. Or harder: show that in this case that `T` has continuum many non-isomorphic models.

* In **number theory** solve some diophantine equations. Show that there are no nonzero integer solutions to `x^4-y^4=z^2`. Find all solutions to `x^2+y^2=z^3` and to `|2^k-3^l|=1`.

* In **planar geometry** many results are missing. Choose one: the theorem of Ceva's theorem, Desargues's theorem, Feuerbach's theorem, Menelaus's theorem, Morley's trisecor theorem.

* [taken] In **set theory** define club sets, stationary sets and prove Fodor's lemma.
